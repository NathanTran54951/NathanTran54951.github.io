        <p>This game is about a cat who wants to explore the world and ultimately destroy the Evil Dog. I implemented a way for players to know the
        HP of the characters. The use of randomness occured with the 4th, 5th, and final dogs. Their starting location was random. The game gets more difficult
        everytime a new dog arrives. The player can lose if his/her sprite's HP goes to 0 or below.</p>
        <p>I created this game because I knew creating it would be fun. The inspiration was the original Legend of Zelda NES. Two successful points was 
        creating the background and creating the sprites. Two obstacles was setting the variables and letting the sprites die at the correct times. If 
        I had more time, I would make the game bigger and more challenging.</p>
        <p>An alg that contributes significantly to this game is the alg that modifies the cat's HP depending on whether it touches the dogs. Also, it 
        changes the background to the lose screen if the cat's HP is lower than one. This is an alg because it's a set of rules.</p>

        <p>The game is about a person who has many choices. The player can choose which choices to make to establish an interesting outcome.</p>

        <p>At first we didn't know what storyline to choose. Evantually, we iterated and made a storyline. A second example is when the story wasn't very coherent.
        We then reiterated the story to make it easier to understand.</p>
        <p>Abstracting scenes into functions made it easier for us to understand the code and makes the code more organized. Organzing scenes
        are a form of procedural abstraction because there are many different storylines, which makes it more abstract.</p>
        <p>I liked LQHS: History, Culture and Development because it was an really good book. I also enjoyed reading Humpty Dumpty because 
        his fall is amusing.</p>
